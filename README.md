# IFD's Human Heart Framework

The human heart framework is developed at the [Institute of Fluid Dynamics (IFD)](http://www.ifd.mavt.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich. It is based on LifeV, which is a C++ parallel finite element library for the solution of PDEs.

In order to compile the framework, some packages are required to be preinstalled. How to set up the environment on the fluidy machines at IFD is explained in the [Github-Wiki](https://github.com/thomaskummer/lifev-em/wiki). The same procedure may work on other systems, but most certainly needs modifications to the config files.

The library is distributed under LGPL license by CMCS – EPFL, E(CM)2 – Emory, MOX – Polimi, REO, ESTIME– INRIA ([Copyright](https://github.com/lifev/lifev/blob/master/Copyright.md)). Some helpful links to the official LifeV distribution are:
